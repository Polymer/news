          <h4>Overview</h4><i>“I appreciate MK Partners flexibility and the knowledge that is there to support us to this day. They’ve maintained a fun attitude and sense of humor throughout the entire process. We wouldn’t be able to review and manage all of these applications that are coming in daily without the help of MK Partners.”</i>
          <ul>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <li>Recruit thousands of baby-boomers to bring them into the world of teaching, with a staff of only two people! </li>
            <li>Deploy a web based applicant portal</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <li>EnCorps relies on their salesforce.com customization to not only track applications but to also track donors and connect them directly with applicants and current teachers. Jennifer is so encouraged with the results that she finds herself
              on the salesforce.com site every day to take advantage of a wide array of features including reports, the dashboard, calendar, email tracking and more. “I’m staring at the application page every day, drawing metrics from it and making updates.</li>
