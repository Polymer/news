                <div>
                  <p>Cloud consulting is a hot industry. &nbsp;New companies are created every day, but they're not all equal. &nbsp;Before you trust your business and money with someone, do some research. &nbsp;An established firm may seem to cost more,
                    but that's because they have a permanent&nbsp;office you can visit, insurance to cover theft and injury, and a large enough staff to ensure that your project is not abandoned. &nbsp;Below is a simple list of steps you should take to
                    protect your investment and ensure your Salesforce implementation is a success.</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>Look at the&nbsp;company's listing on the <a style="display: inline;" href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE" target="_blank">AppExchange</a> to see how much experience they have and how
                      their customers have rated them.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make sure the <a style="display: inline;" href="http://www.mkpartners.com/ContactMe" target="_blank">company's&nbsp;website</a> has their phone number and address. &nbsp;Real companies want to be found.</li>
                    <li>Call their phone number, does it ring someone's cell phone or do they have a receptionist?</li>
                    <li>Lookup their address in <a style="display: inline;" href="https://goo.gl/maps/W0Wrx" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> to make sure it's a building that really exists and not a house.</li>
                    <li>Use <a style="display: inline;" href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1744407,-118.3615736,3a,15y,243.93h,82.57t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1siZtJfTqWea_NTBmq27_16g!2e0" target="_blank">Google Street View</a> to make sure their address is not
                      a private PO Box or empty lot.
                    </li>
                    <li>Search for the&nbsp;business on the <a style="display: inline;" href="http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/" target="_blank">Secretary of State's website</a>, real businesses are registered and&nbsp;file paperwork&nbsp;annually.</li>
                    <li>Search for the&nbsp;business on <a style="display: inline;" href="http://mycredit.dnb.com/search/?busName=MK+Partners&amp;address=&amp;city=North+Hollywood&amp;state=CA&amp;zip=91601&amp;country=US&amp;searchType=heroSearch&amp;dunsLookup=1"
                        target="_blank">Dun &amp; Bradstreet's website</a>;&nbsp;an established business will have a DUNS # and credit history.</li>
                    <li>Ask the company for a copy of their insurance certificate;&nbsp;besides liability insurance they should also have a worker's compensation policy.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>Every big company started&nbsp;as a small one, and we definitely encourage supporting small businesses. &nbsp;A small business you can trust is one whose owners and employees are fully committed to perservering through the good times
                    and bad&nbsp;and that means establishing a permanent footprint.</p>

            <div class="css-expander-hide">
              <p>
                <div>
                  <p>Unlike home-grown applications, cloud-based applications are typically licensed on a per user model. &nbsp;This can be a big deterrent to large organizations that want to benefit from the advantages of a cloud-based application for low-use
                    business purposes.</p>
                  <p>Many of our clients have asked us to help them find the right licensing options for users that need to login to the platform infrequently or sporadically. &nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no concurrent licensing model for Force.com Users
                    available at this time. &nbsp;However, it is an acceptable term of use (and even an encouraged one) to deactivate a user's license in order to activate another user's license. &nbsp;Taking advantage of this ability and the robust ability
                    of the Force.com platform's Apex programming language, we can build an license management engine that will allow you to pool your licenses across your organization.</p>
                  <p> Actual implementations will vary depending on business requirements and whether single sign-on is used, however the basic framework is the same. &nbsp;Let's assume that you have 100 employees that sporadically and infrequently login
                    to the platform to update their emergency contact information. &nbsp;Rather than buying 100 licenses for those employees you have only 25. &nbsp;When an employee wants to login, they go to a custom webpage (which may be built on Force.com
                    Sites), enters their email address and clicks a button. &nbsp;Upon clicking that button, a query is performed to determine if there are any available licenses and if not, an employee with an active license that is has not logged in
                    to the system in x days is deactivated and this employee's user record is activated. &nbsp;The employee is then presented with a password input field and button to login. &nbsp;Should all active users have last login times within the
                    last hour or so, then this employee would be presented with a please try again later message.</p>
                  <p>This simple technique allows you to replicate a concurrent licensing model on top of the Force.com Platform's per user model.</p>

                    As the most innovative Cloud Consulting firm, MK Partners decided to migrate its website from WordPress to Force.com Sites. MK Partners was already a customer of salesforce.com and heavily uses their Salesforce application in daily operations. Since Force.com
                    Sites is included in Salesforce licenses, and a website redesign was being planned, it only made sense to take advantage of the feature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Migration started by loading website assets (html, css, javascript and images) onto the Force.com platform. Once the look and feel was set, custom code was written to automatically create and populate pages with data in Salesforce. This custom code allows
                    non-technical staff to contribute to content to the <a style="display: inline;" href="http://www.mkpartners.com/support">knowledgebase</a> and <a style="display: inline;" href="http://www.mkpartners.com/customers">customer stories</a>                    on
                    <a style="display: inline;" href="http://www.mkpartners.com">www.mkpartners.com</a>. This tight integration enable mkpartners.com to automatically update as employees are doing their daily jobs. For instance, every time a project is
                    marked as completed in Salesforce, the website is updated to reflect the new number of projects completed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a small business, we don't always have the time to focus on marketing. Having Salesforce update our website for us not only saves us time but ensures that our prospects and customers get up-to-date information when they visit our website. Not having
                    to remember additional passwords for an outside content management system is a bonus too.
                  </p>
