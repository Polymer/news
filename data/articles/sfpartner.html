            <p>Cloud consulting is a hot industry. &nbsp;New companies are created every day, but they're not all equal. &nbsp;Before you trust your business and money with someone, do some research. &nbsp;An established firm may seem to cost more, but that's
              because they have a permanent&nbsp;office you can visit, insurance to cover theft and injury, and a large enough staff to ensure that your project is not abandoned. &nbsp;Below is a simple list of steps you should take to protect your investment
              and ensure your Salesforce implementation is a success.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Look at the&nbsp;company's listing on the <a style="display: inline;" href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE" target="_blank">AppExchange</a> to see how much experience they have and how their
                customers have rated them.</li>
              <li>Make sure the <a style="display: inline;" href="/contactme" target="_blank">company's&nbsp;website</a> has their phone number and address. &nbsp;Real companies want to be found.</li>
              <li>Call their phone number. Does it ring someone's cell phone or do they have a receptionist?</li>
              <li>Look up their address in <a style="display: inline;" href="https://goo.gl/maps/W0Wrx" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> to make sure it's a building that really exists and not a house.</li>
              <li>Use <a style="display: inline;" href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1744407,-118.3615736,3a,15y,243.93h,82.57t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1siZtJfTqWea_NTBmq27_16g!2e0" target="_blank">Google Street View</a> to make sure their address is not a private
                PO Box or empty lot.</li>
              <li>Search for the&nbsp;business on the <a style="display: inline;" href="http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/" target="_blank">Secretary of State's website</a>. Real businesses are registered and&nbsp;file paperwork&nbsp;annually.</li>
              <li>Search for the&nbsp;business on <a style="display: inline;" href="http://mycredit.dnb.com/search/?busName=MK+Partners&amp;address=&amp;city=North+Hollywood&amp;state=CA&amp;zip=91601&amp;country=US&amp;searchType=heroSearch&amp;dunsLookup=1"
                  target="_blank">Dun &amp; Bradstreet's website</a>;&nbsp;an established business will have a DUNS # and credit history.</li>
              <li>Ask the company for a copy of their insurance certificate;&nbsp;besides liability insurance, they should also have a worker's compensation policy.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Every big company started&nbsp;as a small one, and we definitely encourage supporting small businesses. &nbsp;A small business you can trust is one whose owners and employees are fully committed to perservering through the good times and bad,&nbsp;and
              that means establishing a permanent footprint.</p>
