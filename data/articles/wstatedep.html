          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>The Business Services Division (BSD) of the Washington State Department of Commerce selected MK Partners from a pool of vendors to replace its Microsoft Dynamics CRM system with Salesforce. MK Partners configured
            Salesforce to meet the complex requirements of four unique business units with locations around the world. We then expanded the project to include a Salesforce-powered web portal that enables County-based agencies to submit reports directly
            to the State without any paperwork and in real time. By migrating to Salesforce, the Department was able to reduce its reliance on IT, increase user adoption, and improve productivity.</p>
