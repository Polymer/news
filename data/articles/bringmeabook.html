          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <ul>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <li> The Bring Me a Book Foundation came to MK Partners realizing it was not utilizing salesforce.com at its full capacity. As a result, it could not effectively track donors or the efficacy of the programs they run. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <li>MK Partners streamlined Bring Me a Book Foundation's instance of salesforce.com to reflect its business needs.</li>
            <li>We optimized donor management process to track targeted campaigns and appeals, track the efficacy of fundraising events and attendance and e-appeals with salesforce.com. Thank you notes to donors are automatically processed to bolster donor
              relationships.
            </li>
            <li>MK Partners developed an automated program management process to track the efficacy of the First Teachers and Bookcase Library (BCL) programs. This solution enabled Bring Me a Book Foundation to contact the teachers they work with at the push
              of a button.</li>
