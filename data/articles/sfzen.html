          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <ul>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <li>The San Francisco Zen Center, already salesforce.com users, needed to modify its set-up to better reflect its needs to manage data, donor relationships, and enable its constituents to serve their needs through its website.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>MK Partners' Solutions</h3>
            <li>MK Partners employed best practices solutions to improve data quality. We also worked with the San Francisco Zen Center to eliminate duplicate records that were causing frustration.</li>
            <li>To enable San Francisco Zen Center constituents to access the information they need online, MK Partners developed sites pages to enable constituents to sign up for programs via the SF Zen Center website and stored in salesforce.com.</li>
