          <p>
            <i>MK Partners meticulously coupled Glow Foundation's database needs with our every day work in the community. We are able to greatly minimize staff time spent on tracking students, donors, and volunteers (which was all done in excel spreadsheets!). Saving time means that Glow Foundation is able to award more college scholarships every year to under-resourced high school students.</i>
