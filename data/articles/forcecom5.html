              <p>As the most innovative Cloud Consulting firm, MK Partners decided to migrate its website from WordPress to Force.com Sites. MK Partners was already a customer of Salesforce.com and heavily uses their Salesforce application in daily operations.
                Since Force.com Sites is included in Salesforce licenses and a website redesign was being planned, it only made sense to take advantage of the feature.</p>
              <p>Migration started by loading website assets (html, css, javascript, and images) onto the Force.com platform. Once the look and feel was set, custom code was written to automatically create and populate pages with data in Salesforce. This custom
                code allows non-technical staff to contribute to the content in <a style="display: inline;" href="list/support">knowledgebase</a> and <a style="display: inline;" href="list/customers">customer stories</a> on <a style="display: inline;" href="http://www.mkpartners.com">www.mkpartners.com</a>.
                This tight integration enables mkpartners.com to automatically update as employees are doing their daily jobs. For instance, every time a project is marked as completed in Salesforce, the website is updated to reflect the new number of projects
                completed.
              </p>
              <p>As a small business, we don't always have the time to focus on marketing. Having Salesforce update our website for us not only saves us time but ensures that our prospects and customers get up-to-date information when they visit our website.
                Not having to remember additional passwords for an outside content management system is a bonus too.</p>
